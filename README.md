## Project Gadget

Gadget is a detective who is good at using Image Embedding's to search for similar images, detect image corrections
and other subtleties.

### Setup


### Sanity Checks

#### (a) Distribution of Image Embedding Vectors

We should always visualize how the Image Embedding Vectors distribute in Euclidean Space after the dimensionality
reduction. The figure shows a sanity check for distributions of embedding vectors for 3 different classes of images:
images that have car, food and dogs within the ROI. The embedding vectors are nicely separated in the phase space.
